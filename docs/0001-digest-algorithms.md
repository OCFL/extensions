  * Authors: OCFL Editors
  * Obsoletes: n/a
  * Obsoleted by: n/a

## Overview

This extension is an index of additional digest algorithms that are defined in community extensions. It provides a list of digest algorithm names that may be used to indicate the given algorith in `fixity` blocks of OCFL Objects, and links their defining extensions.
