# OCFL Community Extensions

This repository is intended as a place for community extensions to the [OCFL Specification and Implementation Notes](https://ocfl.io/). Community extensions are intended as a way to share and collaborate outside of the specification process. They are intended to be citable and mostly static once published. Substantial revisions of content beyond simple fixes warrants publishing a new extension, perhaps marking the old one deprecated. Anybody may propose a community extension via a pull-request (PR) against this repository. The community will review and discuss it before it is merged in.

The current set of extensions can be read on [GitHub Pages](https://ocfl.github.io/extensions/).

## Organization of this repository

Community extensions should be written as GitHub flavored markdown in the [`docs`](docs√ü) directory of this repository. They should be numbered sequentially using a 4-digit, zero-padded prefix; should use hyphens to separate words; and have the `.md` extension.

An example/template is available in this repository as [OCFL Community Extension](docs/0000-example-extension) and is rendered via GitHub pages as https://ocfl.github.io/extensions/0000-example-extension
